                                These service providers only have access to the information necessary to perform their functions and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                        <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
                        <p>The security of your data is a top priority for us. We implement and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
                        <p>Measures include:

                        <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                        <p>We will retain your personal information and scheduled messages only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, primarily as long as your account is active or your messages are pending delivery according to your schedule.</p>
                        <p>Upon your request for account deletion, or after your messages have been sent or deleted by you, we will take reasonable steps to delete or anonymize your personal information in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable law, unless we are legally required to retain it.</p>

                        <h2>7. Your Data Rights</h2>
